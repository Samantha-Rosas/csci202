                     My name is Samantha Rosas, my internet use mainly involves a lot of social media platforms, such as Instagram and Snapchat. I also enjoy using Spotify and Letterboxd. For video streaming I like to use Netflix. I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I think that the internet is a very important aspect of our daily lives. It connects us to are loved ones whether they are across town or in a different country. It makes it easy for me to talk to my family in Mexico using Facetime.
