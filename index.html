                     My name is Samantha Rosas, my internet use mainly involves a lot of social media platforms, such as Instagram and Snapchat. I also enjoy using Spotify and Letterboxd. Letterboxd allows me to rate, review, keep track of movies I have watched and want to watch in the future. For video streaming I like to use Netflix. I enjoy spending time with my friends and family and taking photos while doing so to capture moments with them. I use my iPhone to take all my photos,so I am always able to look back at them. I think that the internet is a very important aspect of our daily lives. It connects us to are loved ones whether they are across town or in a different country. For my family in particular Facetime is a really awesome way to communicate with our family in Mexico. To add in some information from the readings, I do think that the internet provides so much information from our cultures from the past up to the present. You can easily see how much technology has grown from the telegraph.
